A small text based adventure game using simple if else if and scanner capabilities in java.

Review is welcome not only for code but also the english and grammatical sense. Also I think it would be super cool if you want to translate it into another language.

Also I'm not that great with java so as of now it runs via the cmd however I think it would be cool to have a window with a picture and then the text caption below with two buttons for the two choices. 

Furthermore I know the whole don't have nested if statements for ever and I won't because eventually the game will end.
Also nest switches are just as bad as ifs

Finally if I didn't mention that I'm not super great at java one question I have is that is there anything bad that comes from having it all in one class or one file to break up work load? Just wondering.

Finally I apologize for any formatting weirdness I want a way for it to be semi-easy to read

**This is a little important if you want to understand the soure**

If you're looking at the source the method to naming variable goes likes this
[Number of choice][Scanner or String][Version of choice]
So for the fifth choice you make and whether you choose option one or two you'll get FiveScanOne/FiveScanTwo or FiveAnswerOne/FiveAnsewrTwo depending on which part you're reading.

I don't know how accurate this system is because I get a little lost sometimes because I'm not a code guru so please if you spot a mistake tell me. Thanks :)
